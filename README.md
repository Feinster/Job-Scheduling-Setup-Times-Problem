# About 
The Job Scheduling with Setup Times Problem is an optimization problem where a set of jobs needs to be scheduled on one or more machines. 
Each job has an associated processing time, and there are setup times between certain job pairs. 
The objective is to find an optimal sequence of execution to minimize the total completion time of jobs or other specific objectives.
